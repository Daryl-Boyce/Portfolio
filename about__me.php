                Dedicating myself to tasks and making sure they are well structured,
                so they can operate cohesively and concisely is something I pride 
                myself on. Along with this, turning my passion hobby of programming
                into a professional and enriching career is something I am keen to achieve.
            </p>
            <p>            
                Through opportunities in education and participating in alpha/beta testing
                of numerous app & games I have gained a decent understanding of how to 
                analyse and effective give feedback that not only helps the projects.
                But also to bolster my own ability. Teaching myself basic programming 
                from a young age, I continue to learn and increase my ability daily, 
                enjoying the process with every step.
            </p>
            <p>
                Able to break down most tasks and have a competent understanding of the 
                tools needed, allows me to maximise my productivity and workflow.  
                From this, I find myself being able to plan more efficiently and 
                communicate this clearly when working as part of a team.
